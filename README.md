# My Personal Project

## Product Inventory Manager Application
**Proposal:** This application is a product inventory manager which would be used by anyone who wants to organize their product inventory in various ways. This application could be useful for manufacturing companies, stores and other businesses which have an inventory of products they want to sell. This project is of interest to me as it would allow me to apply my programming skills to create a desktop application which has practical use in the real world.
